# 📘 Manager README –  Rajan Rawat

Welcome! This is my **Manager README** — think of it like an open-source project guide.  
It’s not set in stone, it evolves as I do. Treat it as documentation for how I work, what I value, and how you can work best with me.  

---

## 👋 About Me
I’m a **strategic and operational leader** who believes project management is as much about **people** as it is about **delivery**.  
I enjoy helping teams navigate friction, find alignment, and move with clarity.  

Outside work: I recharge by **reading**, **reflecting**, and **spending time with family and friends**.  

---

## 🌟 My Leadership Philosophy
- **Clarity over control** → My role is to create focus, not micromanage.  
- **Collaboration over command** → The best solutions come from the team.  
- **Growth over comfort** → I’ll challenge you to stretch, but support you.  
- **Transparency always** → If I know something relevant, you’ll know it too.  

---

## 🛠️ How I Work
- I value **structured planning**, but adapt to shifting priorities.  
- **No surprises** → I value frequent communication.  
- I turn **ambiguity into clarity** with the team.  
- I like to **ship often** → progress beats perfection.  

---

## 🤝 What You Can Expect from Me
- I’ll **remove roadblocks** so you can focus.  
- I’ll **give credit publicly and feedback privately**.  
- I’ll **listen first** before making decisions.  
- I’ll **support your growth** with stretch opportunities.  
- I’ll **admit mistakes** and course-correct openly.  

---

## 📣 What I Expect from You
- Bring **problems with possible solutions**.  
- Communicate **early if blocked**.  
- Take **ownership of outcomes**.  
- Challenge me **respectfully if you disagree**.  
- Invest in the **team, not just your tasks**.  

---

## 💬 Feedback
- I give feedback **directly but constructively** — expect regular check-ins.  
- I want feedback too: how I’m leading, what’s working, and what’s not.  
- Anonymous feedback is welcome if it helps you be candid.  

---

## 🧭 My Quirks
- I sometimes step in **too quickly to resolve friction** — tell me if you need space.  
- I can default to **strategy and structure** — remind me if creativity is needed.  
- I prefer **action-oriented discussions** — long abstract debates drain me.  

---

## 🚀 Why Work With Me
I aim to build a culture where:  
- You feel **safe to take risks**.  
- Success is **shared**, and learning from failure is celebrated.  
- We’re not just delivering software — we’re **building careers, leaders, and trust**.
